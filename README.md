This is my personal iTerm semantic history script. It handles any text that I command-click on in iTerm2.

Functions so far:

* Open paths in PyCharm and bring PyCharm to front

### To Install: ###

1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Go to Preferences -> Profiles -> Advanced -> Semantic History -> Run command ... and enter something like:

		/usr/local/bin/python3 ~/Projects/iterm_semantic_history/script.py "\1" "\2" "\5"
